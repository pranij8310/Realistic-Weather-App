# Realistic-Weather-App
A weather app provides real-time, hyperlocal, and forecasted meteorological data—including temperature, precipitation, wind, and air quality—to help users plan their day. These applications often feature interactive maps, severe weather alerts (storms, floods), and 10-day to 240-hour, long-term forecasts.
